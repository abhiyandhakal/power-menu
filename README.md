# Power Menu

It is a power menu application written in Tauri.

## ÔÅ± WARNING

Logging out only works on linux using Xorg. For logging out, this application just kills Xorg.

## Why Tauri?

I only knew ElectronJS for desktop application development before (was a complete soydev). Now, I know a bit of rust, so why not use Tauri? More so, since the bundle size of Tauri application is smaller than that of ElectronJS.

## Installation
Look at our [ releases ](https://github.com/abhiyandhakal/power-menu/releases) page.
